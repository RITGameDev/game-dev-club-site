Inspired by true allergic reactions, The Itch is a 2D platformer where you transfer and absorb energy from the world around you while searching for a cure to a virus living inside you. Along the way, you'll have to navigate tangled vines, clear up blocked passages, and discover clues about the origin of this deadly virus.
