# Game Dev Club Site

## Getting Started

The site is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/), a static website generator running off of Ruby. 

To get started with running Jekyll, just follow the instructions on their website [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)


## Contributing 

If you want to make changes to the site there are a couple of things to consider: 

Do your work on a seperate branch with a meaningful name, i.e. `update-location` or `change-logo`. 

When you are done with your changes, then simply make a pull request to `master` and the PR will undergo a review, and then be merged in if successful. 


If you have a change to the core site (i.e. CSS stylings that effect more than just your post, layout options, etc) then feel free to make an issue with what you think should change!
